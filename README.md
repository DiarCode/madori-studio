# madori-studio
Madori is a minimalist 2D→3D interior studio that turns precise floor plans into living, explorable spaces. Draw walls, snap in doors and windows, and watch your layout instantly become a clean 3D shell you can orbit, measure and refine — as intuitive as a game, as accurate as pro CAD.
